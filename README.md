# coRider PWA

A **PWA** was made using the Vite PWA plugin for coRider and built with React and TypeScript. This application enhances the ride-sharing experience by providing a seamless, offline-first interface.

## Features

- **Fast Performance:** Leveraging Vite for lightning-fast builds and hot module replacement.
- **Offline Support:** Shows previous fetched messages when offline and a toast to notify the user.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes.
  
## Future Updates

- **Service Worker:** Leverage the Service-Worker file for better offline support and automatic update of PWA on new version releases.
- **Cache Management:** Better cache management for icons and favicons using the service worker.
